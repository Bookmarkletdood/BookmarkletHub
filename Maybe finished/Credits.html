<!-- I have no idea when this is gonna be published to GitHub but as of 5/27/23, this code is very bad. This message is gonna be removed once I make a .css file for this and stop using the CSS file for BookmarkletHub.css but it's probably gonna take a bit of time to remove all the CSS from the HTML -->
