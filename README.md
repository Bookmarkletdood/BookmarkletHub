# BookmarkletHub
This is a project I am currently making called the ‚ÄúBookmarkletHub‚Äù. This is supposed to be a page with a TON of bookmarklets. (And maybe files? Scroll to the bottom for information on that.)
# How to download (Doesn't work yet.)
It does not work cause there is no file but how you will download it is a .zip file. You download it and then go to your files and double-click until you find the ‚ÄúBookmarkletHub.html‚Äù file. (for Chromebook) If you're on Windows (this is the best way I know because I develop on mobile) it (probably) automatically opens on Notepad or a coding software so you have to click open in Chrome. 
# Status
# BookmarkletHub.html
I am making the design (as of 5/26/23) but this is how it will go.
#1 üü© Credits
#2 ‚¨õÔ∏è Other pages
#3 üü® Design
#4 ‚¨õÔ∏è Bookmarklets
# BookmarkletHub.css
I'm pretty sure that the CSS file is done but I'm a beginner coder so don't expect it to be done. (It will still be published on this page tho.)
# BookmarkletHub.js
This is the part I'm working on right now (as of 5/26/23). It is probably not gonna be finished soon
# Extra stuff
This is what I have done in this project and what I am trying to do/make.
# Finished
#1 Make a background png.
#2 Link .CSS and .js files.
#3 Move CSS in the HTML file to its own CSS file.
# Almost finished
#1 Find a good color to make the text.
#2 Starting the credits part
# Not finishing any time soon
The entire project
#2 Making a menu to switch between bookmarklets and credits
# Adding files maybe?
I might add files that work just the way you download this one, but you should expect that in 2024. And if I do then trust me that there will be TONS of stuff.
