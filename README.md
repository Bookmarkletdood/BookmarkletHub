# BookmarkletHub
This is a project I am currently making called the “BookmarkletHub”. This is supposed to be a page with a TON of bookmarklets.
# Status
# BookmarkletHub.html
I am making the design but this is how it will go.
#1 Design
#2 Bookmarklets
#3 Credits
# BookmarkletHub.css
I'm pretty sure that the CSS file is done but I'm a beginner coder so don't expect it to be done. (It will still be published on this page tho.)
# BookmarkletHub.js
This is the part I'm working on right now (as of 5/26/23). It is probably not gonna be finished soon
# Extra stuff
This is what I have done in this project and what I am trying to do/make.
# Finished
#1 Make a background png.
#2 Link .CSS and .js files.
#3 Move CSS in the HTML file to its own CSS file.
# Almost finished
#1 Find a good color to make the text.
#2 Starting the credits part
# Not finishing any time soon
The entire project
#2 Making a menu to switch between bookmarklets and credits
# Adding files maybe?
I might add files that work just the way you download this one, but you should expect that in 2024.
